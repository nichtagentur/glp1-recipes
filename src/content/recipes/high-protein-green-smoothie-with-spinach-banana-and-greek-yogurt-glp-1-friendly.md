ingredients:
  - "1 cup fresh baby spinach, loosely packed (or 1/2 cup frozen spinach, thawed and squeezed dry)"
  - "1/2 medium ripe banana, frozen (about 60g -- freeze ripe bananas in advance for best texture)"
  - "3/4 cup plain nonfat Greek yogurt (look for 15-17g protein per 3/4 cup on the label)"
  - "1 scoop unflavored or vanilla whey or plant-based protein powder (about 25g powder, yielding ~20g protein)"
  - "1 tablespoon natural almond butter, no added sugar or oil"
  - "1 tablespoon ground flaxseed (adds omega-3s and 2g fiber)"
  - "1 tablespoon hemp seeds (adds 3g protein and healthy fats)"
  - "3/4 cup unsweetened almond milk or oat milk (add more for a thinner consistency)"
  - "1/2 cup ice cubes"
  - "1/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract (optional, enhances sweetness without added sugar)"
  - "Pinch of fine sea salt (amplifies all flavors -- do not skip)"
instructions:
  - "If using fresh spinach, rinse the leaves and shake off excess water. If using frozen spinach, thaw it and squeeze out as much liquid as possible using a clean kitchen towel -- this prevents a watery smoothie."
  - "Add the almond milk to your blender first. This is the key technique for a smooth blend: liquid goes in before solids so the blades can move freely without jamming."
  - "Add the Greek yogurt directly on top of the liquid, followed by the protein powder. Layering protein sources this way ensures they incorporate evenly without clumping."
  - "Add the spinach, frozen banana, almond butter, ground flaxseed, hemp seeds, vanilla extract (if using), and salt."
  - "Place ice cubes on top -- ice on top helps push everything down toward the blades at the start of blending."
  - "Blend on high speed for 60-90 seconds until completely smooth and vibrant green with no visible spinach flecks. Stop and scrape down the sides with a spatula if needed, then blend again for 15 seconds."
  - "Taste and adjust: if you want it sweeter, add 3-4 drops of liquid stevia or a small Medjool date (adds ~20 calories and 1g fiber). If too thick, add almond milk one tablespoon at a time."
  - "Pour immediately into a chilled glass and serve right away. Smoothies with Greek yogurt and protein powder thicken significantly as they sit, so drink within 10-15 minutes for best texture."
  - "Optional garnish: a small sprinkle of hemp seeds and a thin banana slice on the rim for a beautiful presentation."

The glass sits on a light gray marble surface with a folded linen napkin, a small bowl of fresh spinach leaves, and a halved banana nearby as props. Soft, diffused natural window light from the left creates gentle shadows. The color of the smoothie is a rich, deep green -- not murky, not neon -- with a velvety, thick texture visible through the glass. Minimal, clean food styling."

If you have ever typed 'green smoothie' into a search bar, you already know the struggle: most recipes are beautiful on Instagram and deeply unsatisfying in real life, leaving you hungry an hour later and wondering why you even bothered.

I have been making green smoothies for over a decade, and I have tested probably fifty versions of this one specifically since starting to focus on GLP-1 friendly nutrition. The thing that makes a green smoothie actually work for people on medications like semaglutide or tirzepatide is not the spinach — it is the protein-to-fiber ratio. You need both working together to support the satiety signals that GLP-1 medications amplify.

Most popular green smoothie recipes online use a banana, some spinach, maybe almond milk, and call it a day. That version comes in around 8-10g of protein at best. It tastes fine, but it does not do the nutritional job you need it to do when you are eating smaller volumes and relying on every bite (or sip) to count.

This version layers three strategic protein sources: Greek yogurt, protein powder, and hemp seeds. Together, they hit 30 grams of protein in a single glass without making it taste chalky or heavy. The trick is using nonfat Greek yogurt as your creamy base instead of full-fat coconut milk or avocado — you get the thick, velvety texture everyone loves without the extra calories.

The frozen banana is non-negotiable. A room-temperature banana gives you a thin, watery result. A frozen one creates that milkshake-thick consistency that makes this smoothie feel indulgent even though it sits at 320 calories. I keep a zip-top bag of ripe, sliced bananas in my freezer at all times — peel them when they are perfectly ripe and spotted, because that is when their natural sweetness is highest and you will not need any added sugar.

A word on spinach: fresh and frozen both work beautifully here. Fresh gives a slightly brighter green color; frozen is more convenient and equally nutritious. Just make absolutely sure you squeeze frozen spinach dry before adding it, or your smoothie will taste thin and slightly bitter.

The one mistake I see most often is under-blending. You need a full 60-90 seconds on high speed to break down the spinach cell walls completely. Under-blended spinach is gritty and leaves a grassy aftertaste that turns people off green smoothies forever. Give it time, and it becomes completely invisible in flavor.

With 8 grams of fiber from the flaxseed, banana, and spinach combined, this smoothie supports healthy digestion — something especially important when adjusting to GLP-1 medications, which can slow gastric emptying. Every ingredient here is easy to digest, gentle on the stomach, and designed to keep you satisfied for hours.
