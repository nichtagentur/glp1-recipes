ingredients:
  - "1 cup frozen mixed berries (blueberries, strawberries, raspberries — no added sugar; frozen gives a thicker texture than fresh)"
  - "1 scoop (about 30g) unflavored or vanilla whey protein isolate (look for one with at least 25g protein per scoop and minimal fillers)"
  - "1 cup plain, unsweetened Greek yogurt, 2% fat (not non-fat — the slight fat content helps with satiety and flavor)"
  - "1 tablespoon chia seeds (adds omega-3s and 5g fiber; let them sit in liquid briefly so they bloom and blend smoothly)"
  - "1/2 cup unsweetened almond milk (or any unsweetened non-dairy milk; adjust to achieve your preferred thickness)"
  - "1/2 cup fresh baby spinach, lightly packed (you will not taste it — it vanishes behind the berries and adds extra fiber and iron)"
  - "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract (enhances sweetness without added sugar)"
  - "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon (helps moderate blood sugar response and adds warmth to the berry flavor)"
  - "4–5 ice cubes (for a frostier, thicker texture)"
instructions:
  - "Add the liquid first: Pour the almond milk into the blender before any other ingredient. This prevents protein powder from clumping at the blade and ensures smoother blending."
  - "Layer strategically: Add the Greek yogurt, then the spinach, then the frozen berries on top. Placing frozen ingredients last keeps the softer ingredients close to the blade where they blend first."
  - "Add the dry ingredients: Sprinkle in the protein powder, chia seeds, vanilla extract, and cinnamon. Avoid packing protein powder on top of cold frozen fruit — it can cause dry pockets. A light sprinkle across the top works best."
  - "Add ice cubes last on top of everything."
  - "Blend on high for 45–60 seconds until completely smooth. Pause after 20 seconds and use a tamper or spatula to push down any ingredients stuck to the sides, then resume blending. The smoothie should be thick, creamy, and uniformly deep purple-pink with no visible green streaks."
  - "Taste and adjust: If you'd like more sweetness, blend in 1/2 a frozen banana (adds ~50 calories). If too thick, add almond milk one tablespoon at a time and pulse. If too thin, add 2–3 more ice cubes and blend for another 15 seconds."
  - "Pour immediately into a chilled tall glass and serve within 5 minutes for best texture. If you notice the chia seeds creating a slightly gelatinous texture as it sits, that's normal — just give it a quick stir."

If you've been searching for a smoothie that actually keeps you full for hours — not just twenty minutes — you've landed in the right place.

I've made hundreds of smoothies over the years, and for a long time, I was making the same mistake most people do: lots of fruit, a splash of juice, maybe some yogurt, and wondering why I was hungry again by 10 a.m. The missing piece was always protein and fiber working together, not just one or the other.

When I started working with clients on GLP-1 medications, this Berry Protein Blast Smoothie became one of the most requested recipes on my blog — and for good reason. GLP-1 medications already support satiety, but they also reduce appetite so much that getting adequate nutrition becomes the real challenge. A smoothie that tastes like a treat but delivers 30 grams of protein and 8 grams of fiber? That's not just convenient. That's strategic.

What makes this version different from a standard berry smoothie is the combination of Greek yogurt AND whey protein isolate. Most recipes use one or the other. Together, they create a slow-and-fast protein release — the whey hits quickly for muscle support, while the casein naturally present in Greek yogurt digests more slowly, extending that full feeling. The chia seeds amplify the fiber content and add a subtle richness without impacting the flavor.

A few things I've learned from making this dozens of times: First, always use frozen berries instead of fresh. Frozen berries are picked at peak ripeness, have equivalent antioxidant levels, and give you that thick, milkshake-like texture without needing excessive ice. Second, don't skip the spinach. I know it sounds counterintuitive, but half a cup of baby spinach in a berry smoothie is completely invisible to your taste buds — it just disappears. You get iron, magnesium, and extra fiber for free. Third, add your liquid to the blender first. It's a small step, but it prevents the protein powder from clumping at the bottom and saves you from a grainy texture.

When buying protein powder for this recipe, look for a whey isolate with minimal ingredients — ideally just whey, a natural sweetener, and perhaps a flavor. Anything with long ingredient lists, artificial thickeners, or excessive sugar alcohols can upset digestion, which matters especially if you're on GLP-1 medication.

At around 290 calories per serving, this smoothie fits perfectly as a GLP-1 friendly breakfast or post-workout recovery meal. It's also genuinely delicious — bright, fruity, creamy, and satisfying in a way that makes you forget it's doing so much nutritional work.
