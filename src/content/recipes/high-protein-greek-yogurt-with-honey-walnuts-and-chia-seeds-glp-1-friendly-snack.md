ingredients:
  - "2 cups plain non-fat Greek yogurt (look for brands with 17-20g protein per cup, such as Fage 0% or Chobani Plain Non-Fat)"
  - "4 teaspoons raw honey (use a good-quality wildflower or clover honey — the floral notes really shine here)"
  - "4 tablespoons raw walnuts, roughly chopped (not pre-toasted; you'll toast them yourself for better flavor)"
  - "4 teaspoons chia seeds (adds fiber and omega-3s without changing the flavor profile)"
  - "1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon, divided (Ceylon cinnamon preferred for its milder, sweeter taste)"
  - "1/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract (optional but highly recommended — it rounds out the yogurt's tartness beautifully)"
  - "Pinch of flaky sea salt (Maldon or similar — just a few crystals per serving transforms the whole dish)"
instructions:
  - "Toast the walnuts: Place the roughly chopped walnuts in a small dry skillet over medium-low heat. Stir constantly for 3-4 minutes until fragrant and lightly golden — you'll smell a nutty, toasty aroma. Watch carefully as they can burn quickly. Transfer immediately to a plate to cool. Toasting is non-negotiable: it deepens the flavor dramatically."
  - "Prepare the yogurt base: Divide the 2 cups of Greek yogurt evenly among 4 small bowls or glasses, about 1/2 cup per serving. If using vanilla extract, stir 1/4 teaspoon into the full batch before portioning for even distribution."
  - "Add the chia seeds: Sprinkle 1 teaspoon of chia seeds directly onto each portion of yogurt. Gently swirl them in with a spoon so they begin to hydrate into the yogurt — this gives the yogurt a slightly thicker, more pudding-like texture within a few minutes."
  - "Drizzle the honey: Add 1 teaspoon of honey to each bowl, drizzling it in a slow zigzag pattern over the surface. Do not stir it in — the visual ribbon of golden honey is part of the experience, and you want distinct pockets of sweetness in each bite."
  - "Top with toasted walnuts: Scatter 1 tablespoon of the cooled toasted walnuts over each bowl. Press them in very lightly so they sit partially embedded in the yogurt rather than sliding off."
  - "Finish with cinnamon and salt: Dust each bowl with a pinch of ground cinnamon (about 1/16 teaspoon per serving) and add just 2-3 crystals of flaky sea salt. The salt is subtle but critical — it amplifies the honey and brings out the walnut's natural sweetness."
  - "Serve immediately for the best texture, or refrigerate for up to 2 hours if meal-prepping. If storing, add the walnuts right before serving to preserve their crunch."

If you've been searching for a snack that actually keeps you full on a GLP-1 medication — one that doesn't feel like punishment — this is the one I come back to every single week.

Greek yogurt with honey and walnuts is one of the oldest, most beloved Mediterranean snacks for a reason. It's the kind of thing you'd find at a small café in Athens, served simply in a little ceramic bowl before a meal. But as beautiful as the traditional version is, it often skips a few nutritional opportunities that make it an even more powerful choice for those of us eating with intention.

I've been making variations of this for years, and the version I'm sharing today is the one I've settled on after a lot of testing. The two changes that make it a standout GLP-1 snack — rather than just a pretty yogurt bowl — are the addition of chia seeds and the intentional choice of a high-protein, non-fat Greek yogurt as the base.

Here's what I want you to know about the yogurt: not all Greek yogurts are created equal. Some brands labeled "Greek-style" are thickened with starch and contain as little as 8g of protein per serving. You want a genuine strained Greek yogurt with at least 17g of protein per cup. Check the label before you buy. Fage 0%, Chobani Plain Non-Fat, and Stonyfield Organic Plain are my go-to choices.

The chia seeds are doing quiet but important work here. One teaspoon adds about 2 grams of fiber and helps the yogurt thicken into something almost pudding-like. For anyone on a GLP-1, fiber is your best friend — it slows digestion further, supports gut health, and extends that feeling of fullness.

Now, about those walnuts: please toast them. I know it adds four minutes, but the difference between raw and toasted is enormous. Raw walnuts have a slightly bitter, papery quality. Toasted walnuts taste rich, buttery, and almost caramel-like. It's the single highest-impact technique in this entire recipe.

The honey — use real honey. A teaspoon is enough to bring genuine sweetness without spiking your blood sugar dramatically, especially when it's surrounded by protein, fat, and fiber that slow glucose absorption. I love a good wildflower or clover honey here; the floral notes complement the tanginess of the yogurt in a way that artificial sweeteners simply can't replicate.

Finally, don't skip the flaky sea salt and cinnamon. Both are tiny additions with outsized flavor payoffs. Ceylon cinnamon in particular has a softer, sweeter profile than the more common cassia variety, and it pairs beautifully with honey without being sharp.

This snack comes together in about five minutes, requires zero cooking (beyond the walnut toast), and delivers around 14 grams of protein and 3 grams of fiber per serving at roughly 165 calories. It's satisfying enough to hold you between meals without weighing you down. Let's get into it.
