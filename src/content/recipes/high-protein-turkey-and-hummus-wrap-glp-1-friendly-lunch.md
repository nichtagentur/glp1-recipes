ingredients:
  - "4 large whole wheat tortillas (10-inch, look for ones with 5g+ fiber and under 160 calories each)"
  - "12 oz thinly sliced oven-roasted turkey breast, nitrate-free preferred (about 3 oz per wrap)"
  - "1 cup roasted red pepper hummus (store-bought or homemade — the roasted red pepper variety adds sweetness and depth)"
  - "2 cups baby spinach leaves, loosely packed (about half a cup per wrap)"
  - "1 large English cucumber, thinly sliced into rounds"
  - "1 cup shredded purple cabbage (adds crunch, fiber, and a beautiful color contrast)"
  - "1/2 cup roasted red peppers, drained and patted dry, sliced into strips"
  - "1/4 cup crumbled reduced-fat feta cheese (adds salty, briny flavor without overdoing the fat)"
  - "2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice"
  - "1 teaspoon dried oregano"
  - "1/2 teaspoon garlic powder"
  - "1/4 teaspoon black pepper, freshly cracked"
  - "Optional: 1 tablespoon everything bagel seasoning for extra crunch and flavor on top of the hummus layer"
instructions:
  - "Prep your vegetables first: thinly slice the cucumber into rounds, drain and dry the roasted red peppers thoroughly (moisture is the enemy of a non-soggy wrap), and shred the purple cabbage if not pre-shredded. Lay out all your components so assembly is quick and organized."
  - "In a small bowl, toss the shredded purple cabbage with the fresh lemon juice, dried oregano, garlic powder, and black pepper. Let it sit for 5 minutes — this quick 'pickle' softens the cabbage slightly and infuses it with flavor, which elevates the whole wrap."
  - "Warm each whole wheat tortilla for 10-15 seconds in the microwave or 20 seconds per side in a dry skillet over medium heat. A warm, pliable tortilla is much easier to roll tightly and won't crack or tear."
  - "Spread 1/4 cup of hummus evenly across each tortilla, leaving a 1-inch border around the edges. Go all the way to the sides — uneven hummus distribution means some bites are dry. If using everything bagel seasoning, sprinkle it lightly over the hummus now."
  - "Layer the fillings in this order for the best structural wrap: start with a handful of baby spinach directly on the hummus (it acts as a moisture barrier between the turkey and the tortilla), then add 3 oz of turkey slices in a single even layer."
  - "Add the cucumber rounds, roasted red pepper strips, and the marinated purple cabbage across the center of the wrap. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of crumbled feta over the top of each wrap."
  - "To roll: fold the left and right sides of the tortilla inward about 1 inch, then roll from the bottom up firmly and tightly, using your fingers to tuck the filling inward as you roll. The tighter the roll, the better it holds together."
  - "Slice each wrap diagonally in half with a sharp serrated knife. Serve immediately, or wrap tightly in parchment paper and refrigerate for up to 24 hours. For meal prep, store the marinated cabbage separately and add just before eating to keep the wrap from getting soggy."

If you're eating lunch on a GLP-1 medication and you're tired of meals that either leave you stuffed and uncomfortable or unsatisfied an hour later, this turkey and hummus wrap is exactly what you've been looking for.

I've made hundreds of wraps over the years — for clients, for my own meal prep, and for my kids who somehow manage to have opinions about everything. What I've learned is that the difference between a wrap you actually crave and one that tastes like a sad desk lunch comes down to three things: the quality of your hummus, how you handle moisture, and the technique you use to build the layers.

This version is built on the classic deli-style turkey and hummus combination that home cooks have loved for years — that creamy, savory, slightly tangy combination that just works. But I've taken it further by adding marinated purple cabbage, roasted red peppers, and fresh cucumber to give it crunch, brightness, and a satisfying complexity that a basic wrap just doesn't have.

For people on GLP-1 medications like semaglutide or tirzepatide, this wrap is particularly well-suited to how your appetite is changing. At around 350 calories per serving, it's substantial without being overwhelming. The 30 grams of protein from lean turkey and hummus helps you stay in that satisfied zone longer, while the 8 grams of fiber — coming from the whole wheat tortilla, chickpeas in the hummus, and all those vegetables — supports healthy digestion and steady blood sugar.

One thing I always tell readers: don't skip drying your roasted red peppers. Excess moisture is what makes wraps turn into a soggy mess by lunchtime. Pat them down with a paper towel before adding them, and your wrap will still be perfectly intact hours later — which matters enormously if you're packing this for work.

When shopping, look for a whole wheat tortilla that lists whole wheat flour as the first ingredient and has at least 5 grams of fiber. For the turkey, choose oven-roasted over smoked or honey-glazed to keep sodium reasonable and avoid added sugars. A good-quality roasted red pepper hummus adds a layer of sweetness and smokiness that plain hummus simply can't match — it's a small swap that makes a big flavor difference.

This is the kind of lunch that makes GLP-1 eating feel effortless rather than restrictive. Let's get into it.
