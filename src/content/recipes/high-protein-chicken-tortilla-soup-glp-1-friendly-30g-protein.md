ingredients:
  - "1.5 lbs boneless, skinless chicken breast (or thighs for more flavor), trimmed of excess fat"
  - "1 tablespoon avocado oil or olive oil"
  - "1 medium yellow onion, diced (about 1 cup)"
  - "1 poblano pepper, seeded and diced (sub green bell pepper for milder heat)"
  - "4 cloves garlic, minced"
  - "1 tablespoon tomato paste"
  - "1 can (14.5 oz) fire-roasted diced tomatoes, undrained"
  - "1 can (15 oz) black beans, drained and rinsed"
  - "1 cup frozen or fresh corn kernels"
  - "4 cups low-sodium chicken broth"
  - "1 teaspoon ground cumin"
  - "1 teaspoon smoked paprika"
  - "1 teaspoon chili powder"
  - "1/2 teaspoon dried oregano"
  - "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste"
  - "1/4 teaspoon black pepper"
  - "Juice of 1 lime (about 2 tablespoons)"
  - "2 small (6-inch) corn tortillas, cut into thin strips (for baking, not frying)"
  - "1/2 teaspoon avocado oil spray (to crisp the tortilla strips)"
  - "1/2 medium avocado, sliced (about 2 oz per serving, for topping)"
  - "1/4 cup fresh cilantro, roughly chopped (for garnish)"
  - "1/4 cup plain nonfat Greek yogurt (sub for sour cream, for topping)"
  - "1 lime, cut into wedges (for serving)"
instructions:
  - "Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Arrange the corn tortilla strips in a single layer on a small baking sheet, spray lightly with avocado oil, and bake for 8-10 minutes, flipping once halfway through, until golden and crispy. Set aside. These will keep for up to 2 days in an airtight container."
  - "While the tortilla strips bake, heat 1 tablespoon of avocado oil in a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat. Add the whole, raw chicken breasts (or thighs) directly to the pot. Sear for 2-3 minutes per side until lightly golden — you are not cooking them through yet, just building color. Remove the chicken and set aside on a plate."
  - "Reduce heat to medium. Add the diced onion and poblano pepper to the same pot. Sauté for 4-5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the onion is soft and translucent and beginning to turn golden at the edges. Add the minced garlic and cook for 60 seconds until fragrant."
  - "Push the vegetables to the sides of the pot and add the tomato paste to the center. Let it cook undisturbed for 1-2 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it deepens in color to a brick-red. This step builds incredible depth of flavor — don't skip it."
  - "Add the cumin, smoked paprika, chili powder, and dried oregano directly to the tomato paste and stir everything together for 30 seconds to bloom the spices."
  - "Pour in the fire-roasted diced tomatoes (with their juices) and chicken broth. Stir well, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot — those bits are pure flavor. Return the seared chicken breasts to the pot, ensuring they are submerged in the liquid."
  - "Bring the soup to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low. Cover and simmer for 18-20 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and registers 165°F on an instant-read thermometer. The chicken should be easy to pierce with a fork."
  - "Remove the chicken from the pot and place it on a cutting board. Use two forks to shred it into bite-sized pieces — the simmered chicken will shred very easily. Return the shredded chicken to the pot."
  - "Add the drained black beans and corn kernels. Stir to combine and simmer uncovered for an additional 5 minutes to heat everything through and allow the soup to thicken slightly."
  - "Remove from heat. Squeeze in the juice of one lime and season with salt and black pepper to taste. Taste the soup now — if it needs brightness, add more lime; if it needs depth, add a pinch more cumin or chili powder."
  - "Ladle into bowls (approximately 1.5 cups per serving). Top each bowl with a few baked tortilla strips, a few avocado slices, a small dollop of plain Greek yogurt, and a sprinkle of fresh cilantro. Serve immediately with a lime wedge on the side."

If you've been searching for a chicken tortilla soup that actually fills you up without leaving you feeling heavy an hour later, you've come to the right place.

Chicken tortilla soup is one of those recipes that lives in a permanent spot on my cold-weather rotation. The versions that made it famous — think smoky, fire-roasted tomatoes, tender shredded chicken, black beans, and that unmistakable cumin-forward broth — are beloved for good reason. They're deeply satisfying, endlessly customizable, and built on ingredients most of us already have in the pantry.

But I've also made the traditional restaurant version enough times to know that the calorie count can quietly creep up. Fried tortilla strips, a heavy dollop of sour cream, shredded cheese, and sometimes a cream-thickened base can turn what should be a high-protein, fiber-rich meal into something that works against your goals — especially if you're on a GLP-1 medication like semaglutide or tirzepatide.

This version keeps everything that makes chicken tortilla soup great and reworks the parts that don't serve you.

The biggest change I made was baking — not frying — the corn tortilla strips. I know it sounds like a small thing, but properly baked strips at 400°F get genuinely crispy. I've tested this probably a dozen times. The key is cutting them thin, using just a light spray of oil, and flipping them halfway. They shatter when you bite them. Nobody misses the fried version.

For the protein, I use 1.5 pounds of chicken breast, which gets seared first for color and flavor, then poached directly in the seasoned broth. This technique is borrowed from the best Mexican home-cooking traditions — the broth infuses the chicken, and the chicken enriches the broth. The result: deeply flavorful, ultra-tender shredded chicken that holds up beautifully, even leftover the next day.

Black beans are doing serious heavy lifting here nutritionally. One serving contributes meaningful fiber, which matters a lot for people on GLP-1s — adequate fiber supports healthy digestion and helps prevent the GI side effects that some people experience when starting these medications. Combined with the chicken, each bowl lands at 30 grams of protein and 8 grams of fiber, which means real, lasting satiety without needing a massive portion.

A word on buying ingredients: use fire-roasted diced tomatoes, not plain. The smokiness they bring is non-negotiable for authentic flavor. For the broth, low-sodium is essential here — you're adding salt to taste at the end, and full-sodium broth with the tomatoes can make the soup overwhelmingly salty.

One common mistake I see: skipping the step of cooking the tomato paste before adding the liquid. That two-minute step of letting the paste caramelize in the pot transforms the entire depth of the broth. Don't rush it.

This soup also meal-preps beautifully. Make a full batch on Sunday and you've got four protein-rich, fiber-packed lunches or dinners ready to go. Just store the tortilla strips separately so they stay crispy.

Let's get into it.
