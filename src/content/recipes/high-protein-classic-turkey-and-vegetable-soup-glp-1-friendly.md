ingredients:
  - "1.25 lbs boneless, skinless turkey breast, cut into 3/4-inch cubes"
  - "1 tablespoon olive oil"
  - "1 medium yellow onion, diced (about 1 cup)"
  - "3 cloves garlic, minced"
  - "3 medium carrots, peeled and sliced into 1/4-inch rounds (about 1.5 cups)"
  - "3 stalks celery, sliced 1/4-inch thick (about 1 cup)"
  - "2 medium zucchini, cut into 1/2-inch half-moons (about 2 cups)"
  - "1.5 cups frozen cut green beans (no need to thaw)"
  - "1 can (15 oz) white cannellini beans, drained and rinsed -- adds protein and fiber"
  - "1 can (14.5 oz) diced tomatoes, no salt added, with juices"
  - "5 cups low-sodium chicken or turkey broth"
  - "1 teaspoon dried thyme"
  - "1 teaspoon dried rosemary, lightly crushed between fingers"
  - "1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika"
  - "1 bay leaf"
  - "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt, plus more to taste"
  - "1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper"
  - "2 tablespoons fresh flat-leaf parsley, chopped, for garnish"
  - "1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice (added at the end to brighten flavors)"
instructions:
  - "Pat the turkey breast cubes dry with paper towels — this helps them brown rather than steam. Season lightly with salt and pepper."
  - "Heat olive oil in a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the turkey in a single layer (work in two batches if needed to avoid crowding) and sear for 2-3 minutes per side until golden. The turkey does not need to be fully cooked through at this stage. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside."
  - "Reduce heat to medium. Add the diced onion and celery to the same pot and cook, stirring occasionally, for 4-5 minutes until softened and the onion is translucent. Add the garlic and cook 1 minute more until fragrant — you should smell it immediately."
  - "Add the sliced carrots and stir to combine with the aromatics. Cook for 2 minutes, allowing the carrots to begin softening slightly."
  - "Pour in the broth and the canned diced tomatoes with their juices. Add the thyme, rosemary, smoked paprika, and bay leaf. Stir well and bring to a boil over high heat."
  - "Once boiling, return the seared turkey to the pot along with the frozen green beans and cannellini beans. Reduce heat to medium-low to maintain a gentle, steady simmer (small bubbles breaking the surface). Cover partially and cook for 20 minutes."
  - "Add the zucchini and continue simmering, uncovered, for another 8-10 minutes until the zucchini is just tender but still holds its shape and the turkey is cooked through (internal temp of 165°F if checking with a thermometer)."
  - "Remove the bay leaf. Stir in the fresh lemon juice to brighten all the flavors — this is a small step that makes a big difference. Taste and adjust salt and pepper as needed."
  - "Ladle into bowls and garnish generously with fresh chopped parsley. Serve immediately. The soup keeps well refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 4 days and freezes beautifully for up to 3 months."

There is something deeply comforting about a pot of turkey and vegetable soup simmering on the stove — and if you are managing your appetite and nutrition on a GLP-1 medication like semaglutide or tirzepatide, this dish might just become your new best friend.

I have been making turkey soup in some form for years, but it took me a while to crack the code on a version that hits every mark: genuinely satisfying, easy to digest, high in protein, and loaded with fiber — all while staying well within the calorie range that works when your hunger signals are shifting. This version is that recipe.

What makes the classic turkey vegetable soup so beloved is its simplicity and depth. The most popular homemade versions rely on a well-built aromatic base of onion, celery, and carrot (the classic mirepoix), good broth, and enough herbs to make the kitchen smell incredible. I stay true to all of that here and add two game-changers: a quick sear on the turkey before it goes into the broth (which builds real savory flavor through browning), and a can of cannellini beans stirred in toward the end.

Those beans are doing a lot of work. They contribute a subtle creaminess to the broth, add a meaningful boost of both protein and soluble fiber, and make the soup far more satiating without adding many calories. For anyone on GLP-1 therapy, where portion sizes are naturally smaller, every calorie needs to count nutritionally — and beans deliver.

A few tips before you get started: Buy turkey breast rather than ground turkey here. The cubed breast holds its texture beautifully in a soup and gives you clean, lean protein without the grainy texture ground meat can develop. Look for low-sodium broth — since you are seasoning throughout, you want control over the salt level, especially since canned tomatoes add their own. Do not skip the lemon juice at the end. I know it sounds minor, but a single teaspoon added off-heat transforms the whole pot, lifting what might otherwise taste flat into something bright and craveable.

One mistake I see often: adding the zucchini too early. It cooks in just 8-10 minutes and becomes mushy if overdone. Add it in the final stretch and you will be rewarded with perfectly tender pieces that hold their shape.

Each bowl clocks in at around 340 calories, 30 grams of protein, and 8 grams of fiber — a combination that supports steady energy and prolonged fullness, which matters whether you are on medication or simply trying to eat more mindfully. It also reheats beautifully, making it one of my favorite meal-prep soups of the season.

Alright — let's make soup.
