ingredients:
  - "2 cups old-fashioned rolled oats (not instant — the texture holds up much better overnight)"
  - "4 tablespoons chia seeds (look for whole black or white chia seeds, both work equally well)"
  - "2 cups plain nonfat Greek yogurt (20g+ protein per cup — Fage or Chobani work beautifully here)"
  - "1 cup unsweetened almond milk (or any unsweetened plant-based milk; use low-fat dairy milk for extra protein)"
  - "2 scoops unflavored or vanilla whey protein powder (or plant-based pea protein; about 50g total, providing ~25g protein)"
  - "2 tablespoons natural almond butter (smooth, no added sugar or oil — for healthy fat and creaminess)"
  - "2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract"
  - "1 tablespoon pure maple syrup or 1 teaspoon monk fruit sweetener (adjust to taste)"
  - "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon"
  - "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt"
  - "1 cup fresh or frozen blueberries (for topping; thaw frozen berries overnight in the fridge)"
  - "2 tablespoons hemp seeds (for topping — adds 3g protein and a nutty finish per serving)"
instructions:
  - "In a large mixing bowl, combine the rolled oats and chia seeds. Stir them together dry first so the chia seeds distribute evenly throughout — this prevents clumping when the liquid is added."
  - "In a separate medium bowl, whisk together the Greek yogurt, almond milk, protein powder, almond butter, vanilla extract, maple syrup (or monk fruit sweetener), cinnamon, and sea salt. Whisk vigorously for about 60 seconds until the protein powder is fully dissolved and the mixture is smooth with no lumps. A few small bits of almond butter are fine."
  - "Pour the liquid mixture over the dry oat-chia mixture. Stir thoroughly with a rubber spatula, making sure every oat is coated and the liquid is evenly distributed. The mixture will look very loose at this stage — that is completely normal. It will thicken dramatically overnight."
  - "Divide the mixture evenly among 4 wide-mouth mason jars (16 oz jars work perfectly) or any airtight containers. Each portion should be about 3/4 full to leave room for toppings. Press a piece of plastic wrap directly onto the surface or seal the lids tightly."
  - "Refrigerate for a minimum of 6 hours, but ideally 8 hours overnight. The oats and chia seeds will absorb the liquid and expand, creating a thick, pudding-like consistency. If you open the jars after 2–3 hours and the mixture still looks loose, don't panic — just re-stir and return to the fridge."
  - "In the morning, remove the jars from the refrigerator. If the oats have become thicker than you prefer, stir in 1–2 tablespoons of almond milk to loosen them to your desired consistency. Taste and adjust sweetness if needed."
  - "Top each jar with 1/4 cup blueberries and 1/2 tablespoon hemp seeds just before serving. Enjoy cold straight from the jar, or gently warm in the microwave for 60–90 seconds if you prefer a warm breakfast — just add toppings after warming."
  - "Meal prep note: Assembled jars (without fresh toppings) will keep in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. Add fresh fruit and hemp seeds only when ready to eat to prevent the toppings from becoming soggy."

If you've been searching for an overnight oats recipe that actually keeps you full until lunch — not just for an hour — you've landed in exactly the right place.

Most overnight oats recipes are beautifully Instagram-worthy but nutritionally hollow. They're heavy on oats and maple syrup, light on protein, and leave you hungry by 10am. For anyone on a GLP-1 medication like semaglutide or tirzepatide, that blood sugar rollercoaster can work directly against your goals.

I've made overnight oats hundreds of times over the years, and it took me a long time to crack the formula that actually works. The turning point was treating the liquid base like a protein shake rather than just milk — whisking in Greek yogurt AND protein powder together. That one change takes this recipe from about 8–10g of protein per serving to a powerhouse 30 grams.

The chia seeds aren't just a trendy addition here. They pull triple duty: thickening the oats into that signature creamy pudding texture, adding 3–4 grams of fiber per serving, and contributing healthy omega-3 fats that support satiety. When you're working with a reduced appetite from GLP-1 medications, every bite needs to count nutritionally — and chia seeds earn their spot.

Old-fashioned rolled oats are non-negotiable in this recipe. Instant oats turn into a mushy paste overnight, while steel-cut oats don't soften enough without cooking. Rolled oats hit the perfect sweet spot: they soften beautifully while maintaining just enough chew. Look for certified gluten-free rolled oats if you have any sensitivity.

One mistake I see constantly: people don't whisk the protein powder into the wet ingredients before adding it to the oats. If you dump it in dry, it clumps into chalky pockets that never fully dissolve. Always whisk it into the yogurt and milk first — 60 seconds of effort makes the entire texture smooth and creamy.

For the protein powder, I recommend an unflavored or vanilla whey isolate for the cleanest flavor. Plant-based pea protein works too, but it can make the texture slightly gritty — just something to know going in. The almond butter adds a subtle richness that rounds everything out without tipping the calorie count, and it helps slow glucose absorption.

At 350 calories, 30g of protein, and 8g of fiber per serving, this breakfast is designed to work with your GLP-1 medication — supporting steady energy, reducing cravings, and making the most of your limited appetite window.

Make a full batch on Sunday and you'll have breakfast handled for five days straight. Let's get into it.
