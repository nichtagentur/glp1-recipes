ingredients:
  - "1.5 lbs boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 4 medium breasts)"
  - "1 tbsp olive oil"
  - "1 tsp garlic powder"
  - "1 tsp smoked paprika"
  - "0.5 tsp dried oregano"
  - "0.5 tsp black pepper"
  - "0.5 tsp kosher salt"
  - "3 large romaine lettuce hearts, chopped (about 10 cups)"
  - "1 cup canned chickpeas, drained, rinsed, and patted dry"
  - "1 tsp olive oil (for chickpeas)"
  - "0.25 tsp garlic powder (for chickpeas)"
  - "1 oz shaved or freshly grated Parmesan cheese (about 4 tbsp)"
  - "1 cup whole grain croutons"
  - "3 tbsp light Caesar dressing"
  - "1 tbsp fresh lemon juice"
  - "1 tsp Worcestershire sauce"
  - "1 tbsp plain nonfat Greek yogurt"
  - "2 tsp Dijon mustard"
  - "1 small garlic clove, minced"
  - "0.25 tsp black pepper (for dressing)"
instructions:
  - "Pound the chicken breasts to an even 0.75-inch thickness using a meat mallet or rolling pin to ensure even cooking."
  - "In a small bowl, combine olive oil, garlic powder, smoked paprika, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper. Rub the mixture evenly over both sides of each chicken breast. Let marinate at room temperature for 10 minutes."
  - "Preheat a grill or grill pan over medium-high heat. Lightly coat the grates with nonstick cooking spray."
  - "Grill the chicken for 6-7 minutes per side, or until the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C). Remove from heat and let rest for 5 minutes before slicing into thin strips."
  - "While the chicken rests, toss the drained chickpeas with 1 tsp olive oil and 0.25 tsp garlic powder in a small bowl. Add them to a dry skillet over medium-high heat and cook for 5-6 minutes, stirring occasionally, until lightly crisped and golden. Remove from heat."
  - "Prepare the lightened Caesar dressing by whisking together the light Caesar dressing, Greek yogurt, fresh lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, Dijon mustard, minced garlic, and black pepper in a small bowl until smooth and creamy."
  - "Place the chopped romaine lettuce into a large salad bowl. Drizzle two-thirds of the dressing over the lettuce and toss well to coat every leaf evenly."
  - "Divide the dressed romaine equally among four serving plates or shallow bowls."
  - "Top each salad with an equal portion of the sliced grilled chicken, crisped chickpeas, and whole grain croutons."
  - "Drizzle the remaining dressing over each plate, then finish with shaved Parmesan cheese and an optional squeeze of fresh lemon juice. Serve immediately."

Crisp, bright green romaine lettuce leaves form the base, topped with evenly fanned slices of golden-brown grilled chicken breast with visible grill marks. Golden crisped chickpeas and rustic whole grain croutons are scattered throughout. Thin curls of shaved Parmesan cheese drape over the top, and a light, creamy Caesar dressing glistens on the leaves. A wedge of lemon sits on the side of the plate. Shot from a 45-degree angle in bright natural daylight on a light marble surface, with a small white ramekin of extra dressing nearby."
