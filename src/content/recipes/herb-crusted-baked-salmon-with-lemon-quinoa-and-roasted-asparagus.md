ingredients:
  - "4 salmon fillets (6 oz each, skin-on)"
  - "3 tablespoons fresh flat-leaf parsley, finely chopped"
  - "2 tablespoons fresh dill, finely chopped"
  - "1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves"
  - "3 tablespoons almond flour"
  - "2 teaspoons lemon zest (from 1 large lemon)"
  - "2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice"
  - "2 teaspoons Dijon mustard"
  - "2 garlic cloves, minced"
  - "1 tablespoon olive oil"
  - "1/4 teaspoon sea salt"
  - "1/4 teaspoon black pepper"
  - "1/8 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes (optional)"
  - "1 cup dry quinoa, rinsed"
  - "2 cups low-sodium vegetable broth"
  - "1 lb fresh asparagus, woody ends trimmed"
  - "1 teaspoon olive oil (for asparagus)"
  - "Lemon wedges, for serving"
instructions:
  - "Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper and lightly coat with cooking spray."
  - "Cook the quinoa: In a medium saucepan, combine rinsed quinoa and vegetable broth. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce to a simmer, cover, and cook for 14–15 minutes until all liquid is absorbed. Remove from heat and let steam, covered, for 5 minutes. Fluff with a fork and stir in 1 tablespoon of the lemon juice and half the lemon zest. Set aside."
  - "Prepare the herb crust: In a small bowl, combine chopped parsley, dill, thyme, almond flour, remaining lemon zest, minced garlic, salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes (if using). Mix well until the herbs are evenly distributed throughout the almond flour mixture."
  - "Prep the salmon: Pat the salmon fillets dry with paper towels and place them skin-side down on one half of the prepared baking sheet. Brush the top of each fillet evenly with Dijon mustard, then drizzle with 1 tablespoon of olive oil."
  - "Apply the herb crust: Gently press a generous, even layer of the herb-almond mixture onto the mustard-coated top of each salmon fillet, creating a uniform crust about 1/4-inch thick."
  - "Prep the asparagus: Arrange the trimmed asparagus spears in a single layer on the other half of the baking sheet. Drizzle with 1 teaspoon of olive oil, season with a pinch of salt and pepper, and toss gently to coat."
  - "Bake: Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and roast for 16–20 minutes, depending on the thickness of the salmon. The salmon is done when it flakes easily with a fork and the herb crust is golden and fragrant. The asparagus should be tender-crisp with lightly charred tips."
  - "Plate the dish: Divide the lemon quinoa evenly among four plates. Place one herb-crusted salmon fillet over the quinoa on each plate and arrange a portion of roasted asparagus alongside."
  - "Finish and serve: Squeeze a fresh lemon wedge over each plate just before serving. Serve immediately for the best texture and flavor."
