ingredients:
  - "1.5 lbs fresh broccoli crowns (about 2 large heads), cut into medium florets with 1-2 inch stems attached"
  - "4 cloves fresh garlic, very thinly sliced (not minced -- slices roast better and don't burn as easily)"
  - "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil"
  - "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt"
  - "1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper"
  - "1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional, for gentle heat)"
  - "1.5 oz (about 1/2 cup) freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano or high-quality Parmesan, divided"
  - "1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice (from about half a lemon)"
  - "1 teaspoon lemon zest"
  - "2 tablespoons raw pepitas (pumpkin seeds), for added protein and crunch"
instructions:
  - "Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C) and place one large sheet pan (or two smaller ones) inside while the oven heats. A hot pan is the single most important step -- it creates immediate contact heat that jumpstarts caramelization instead of steaming the broccoli."
  - "Wash the broccoli florets and dry them VERY thoroughly with a clean kitchen towel or paper towels. Any residual moisture will steam the broccoli and prevent the crispy, charred edges everyone loves. This step is non-negotiable."
  - "In a large mixing bowl, toss the dry broccoli florets with the olive oil, sliced garlic, salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes (if using). Use your hands to ensure every floret is evenly coated, rubbing the oil into the crowns."
  - "Carefully remove the hot sheet pan from the oven (use oven mitts). Spread the broccoli in a single layer, cut-side down where possible, with plenty of space between pieces. Crowding the pan causes steaming -- if you need to, use two pans. Scatter the garlic slices across the pan as well."
  - "Roast at 425°F for 12 minutes without opening the oven door. Then sprinkle half the grated Parmesan over the broccoli and return to the oven for another 8-10 minutes, until the florets are deeply browned at the edges, the stems are tender when pierced with a fork, and the Parmesan forms golden, slightly crispy bits. The florets closest to the pan edge will char slightly -- that's the goal."
  - "While the broccoli roasts, toast the pepitas in a dry skillet over medium heat for 2-3 minutes, stirring frequently, until they begin to pop and turn lightly golden. Remove from heat immediately and set aside."
  - "Transfer the roasted broccoli to a serving platter. Immediately drizzle with fresh lemon juice and scatter the lemon zest over the top. Finish with the remaining Parmesan and the toasted pepitas."
  - "Serve right away while the edges are still crispy. This dish does not hold well -- roasted broccoli is best eaten within 10 minutes of coming out of the oven."

If you've ever Googled 'why is my roasted broccoli soggy,' you already know the frustration. You wanted those crispy, charred, almost-caramelized florets you've seen on every food blog and restaurant menu — and instead you got a pile of steamed, olive-drab vegetables that nobody wanted to eat. I've been there too, and I spent a long time figuring out exactly what the most popular versions of this dish do differently.

Garlic roasted broccoli has earned its status as one of the most-loved vegetable side dishes for good reason. When it's done right — screaming hot oven, bone-dry florets, a hot pan, and the right amount of fat — broccoli transforms completely. The natural sugars caramelize, the edges char, and the stems become almost meaty and tender. Add garlic and Parmesan, and it becomes genuinely craveable.

For people on GLP-1 medications like semaglutide or tirzepatide, this dish is a quiet superstar. Broccoli is one of the highest-fiber vegetables you can eat, delivering about 3-4 grams of fiber per cup, which supports the slower digestion that complements how these medications work. Fiber also feeds beneficial gut bacteria, supports blood sugar stability, and keeps you feeling satisfied on smaller portions — all priorities when you're eating less overall.

I've added two simple upgrades to the classic version that make this genuinely protein-supportive: freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano and toasted pepitas. Parmesan is often overlooked as a protein source, but a half-ounce serving delivers about 4 grams. Pepitas add another 2-3 grams along with magnesium and healthy fats. Together, they push this side dish to nearly 9 grams of protein per serving, which matters when you're working with reduced appetite and need every bite to count.

A few things to know before you start. First, buy broccoli crowns that are dark green with tightly packed florets — avoid any with yellowing or a sulfurous smell, both signs of age. Second, and I cannot say this enough: dry your broccoli completely before it touches the oil. Pat it, let it air dry, pat it again. Water is the enemy of browning. Third, use a preheated pan. It sounds fussy but it takes 30 seconds and makes a visible difference.

Lemon juice goes on at the end, not before roasting — acid added before roasting dulls the color and slows caramelization. A squeeze at the finish brightens every flavor and cuts through the richness of the cheese beautifully.

This recipe comes together in just over 30 minutes, uses one pan, and pairs beautifully with grilled fish, chicken, or even on its own as a light snack. Ready to make the best roasted broccoli of your life? Let's get into it.
