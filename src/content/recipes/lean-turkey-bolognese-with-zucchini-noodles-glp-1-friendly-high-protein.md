ingredients:
  - "1 lb 93% lean ground turkey"
  - "4 medium zucchini (about 2 lbs total), spiralized into noodles"
  - "1 medium yellow onion, finely diced"
  - "3 cloves garlic, minced"
  - "2 medium carrots, finely diced (about 1 cup) — this is the secret to authentic bolognese sweetness"
  - "2 stalks celery, finely diced"
  - "1 can (28 oz) whole San Marzano-style tomatoes, crushed by hand"
  - "2 tablespoons tomato paste"
  - "1/2 cup low-sodium chicken broth"
  - "1/4 cup whole milk or unsweetened oat milk — for authentic bolognese richness"
  - "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided"
  - "1 teaspoon dried oregano"
  - "1/2 teaspoon dried thyme"
  - "1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes"
  - "1 bay leaf"
  - "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt, plus more to taste"
  - "1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper"
  - "1/4 cup fresh basil leaves, torn, for serving"
  - "2 oz Parmigiano-Reggiano, finely grated (about 1/2 cup) — divided among 4 servings"
  - "1 tablespoon fresh flat-leaf parsley, chopped, for garnish"
instructions:
  - "PREP THE SOFFRITTO: Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large, heavy-bottomed skillet or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the diced onion, carrots, and celery. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 8-10 minutes until the vegetables are very soft, lightly golden, and fragrant. Don't rush this step — this soffritto base is what gives the sauce its depth. Add the minced garlic and cook for 1 minute more until aromatic."
  - "BROWN THE TURKEY: Push the vegetables to the edges of the pan and add the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil to the center. Add the ground turkey and increase heat to medium-high. Break it up with a wooden spoon into very fine crumbles — smaller is better for authentic bolognese texture. Cook for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the meat is fully browned with no pink remaining and the bottom of the pan has some golden fond."
  - "BUILD THE SAUCE: Stir in the tomato paste and cook for 2 minutes, stirring constantly, until it darkens slightly to a brick-red color. This caramelizes the paste and removes any raw, tinny flavor. Pour in the chicken broth and stir, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan."
  - "SIMMER LOW AND SLOW: Add the crushed San Marzano tomatoes, milk, oregano, thyme, red pepper flakes, bay leaf, salt, and pepper. Stir everything together and bring to a gentle boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer uncovered for 25-30 minutes, stirring every 5-7 minutes, until the sauce has thickened noticeably and the fat and liquid are mostly absorbed. The sauce should look rich, glossy, and cohesive — not soupy. Remove the bay leaf. Taste and adjust salt as needed."
  - "PREP THE ZUCCHINI NOODLES: While the sauce simmers, spiralize the zucchini into noodles. Place the noodles in a colander, sprinkle with a pinch of salt, toss gently, and let sit for 10 minutes. Pat dry thoroughly with paper towels — removing excess moisture is the single most important step to avoid watery zucchini noodles. Do not skip this."
  - "COOK THE ZUCCHINI NOODLES: Heat a separate large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat (no oil needed). Add the dried zucchini noodles and cook for just 2-3 minutes, tossing frequently, until barely tender but still with a slight bite. They should look bright green and slightly wilted. Do not overcook — zucchini releases water quickly and will become mushy if left too long."
  - "SERVE: Divide the zucchini noodles evenly among four bowls. Ladle the turkey bolognese generously over the top. Finish each bowl with torn fresh basil, a tablespoon of finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, and a pinch of fresh parsley. Serve immediately while everything is hot."

If you've ever googled 'healthy pasta dinner that actually satisfies,' this recipe is the answer you've been waiting for.

I've made bolognese dozens of times over the years — the traditional kind, with ground beef, a splash of whole milk, and a long, lazy Sunday simmer that fills your whole kitchen with that unmistakable, soul-warming aroma. When I started working with clients on GLP-1 medications, my challenge was clear: how do I keep all of that richness, depth, and satisfaction while building something that works with a smaller appetite and a more sensitive stomach?

This lean turkey bolognese is my answer, and honestly, it has become one of the most-made recipes in my household — even on weeks when I'm not actively watching macros.

The secret to making this taste like *real* bolognese and not a diet imitation is two things: the soffritto and the simmer time. Most people skip straight to browning the meat and wonder why their sauce tastes flat. Taking the full 8-10 minutes to slowly cook down onion, carrot, and celery together is non-negotiable — this is where the sweetness, complexity, and body of the sauce come from. The milk is the other move most people overlook. It sounds unexpected, but a small splash tenderizes the turkey and rounds out the acidity of the tomatoes, just like it does in a traditional Bolognese alla Bolognese.

For the zucchini noodles, the biggest mistake I see is skipping the salting and drying step. Zucchini is about 95% water, and if you skip that step, you'll end up with a watery, diluted sauce sitting in a pool at the bottom of your bowl. Salt them, let them sit, and pat them bone-dry before they ever hit the pan. Two to three minutes in a hot, dry pan is all they need.

From a nutritional standpoint, this recipe delivers about 30 grams of protein and 8 grams of fiber per serving at around 350 calories — a combination that supports steady blood sugar and prolonged satiety, which is exactly what you want when you're managing appetite on GLP-1 medications like semaglutide or tirzepatide. Ground turkey is easy to digest and lower in saturated fat than beef, and zucchini is one of the gentlest, most gut-friendly vegetables you can eat.

When shopping, look for 93% lean ground turkey (not 99% — it needs a little fat to stay flavorful and not dry out). For the tomatoes, a whole canned San Marzano-style tomato that you crush by hand will give you a far better texture than pre-crushed or diced canned tomatoes.

This recipe also meal-preps beautifully. Make the bolognese sauce in full and refrigerate for up to four days — just spiralize and cook the zucchini fresh each time you serve it to avoid sogginess.
