ingredients:
  - "1.5 lbs boneless skinless chicken breast, sliced thin against the grain into 1/4-inch strips"
  - "2 cups cooked short-grain brown rice (cook in low-sodium chicken broth for extra flavor)"
  - "2 cups broccoli florets, cut into bite-sized pieces"
  - "1 large red bell pepper, thinly sliced"
  - "1 cup snap peas, strings removed"
  - "1 cup shredded purple cabbage"
  - "1 medium carrot, julienned or shaved with a peeler"
  - "4 cloves garlic, minced"
  - "1 tablespoon fresh ginger, grated (about a 1-inch knob)"
  - "3 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce or tamari (for gluten-free)"
  - "1 tablespoon rice vinegar"
  - "1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil"
  - "2 teaspoons cornstarch mixed with 2 tablespoons cold water (slurry)"
  - "1 tablespoon avocado oil or other high-heat neutral oil, divided"
  - "1 teaspoon chili garlic sauce or sambal oelek (optional, for heat)"
  - "2 green onions, thinly sliced, for garnish"
  - "1 teaspoon sesame seeds, for garnish"
  - "Salt and black pepper to taste"
instructions:
  - "PREP YOUR INGREDIENTS: Before you turn on the heat, have everything sliced, measured, and ready to go. Stir-fry moves fast. Pat the chicken strips completely dry with paper towels — this is the single most important step for getting a golden sear instead of steaming. Season lightly with salt and black pepper."
  - "MIX THE SAUCE: In a small bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, rice vinegar, sesame oil, and chili garlic sauce (if using). Set the cornstarch slurry right next to it. You'll add them in sequence during cooking."
  - "COOK THE CHICKEN IN BATCHES: Heat a large wok or 12-inch stainless steel skillet over high heat until it just begins to smoke — about 90 seconds. Add 1/2 tablespoon avocado oil and swirl to coat. Add the chicken in a single layer without crowding (cook in two batches if needed). Let it sear undisturbed for 2 minutes until golden on one side, then stir-fry for another 2 minutes until cooked through and no longer pink. The internal temperature should reach 165°F. Remove chicken to a clean plate and set aside."
  - "STIR-FRY THE VEGETABLES: Without wiping the pan, add the remaining 1/2 tablespoon avocado oil over high heat. Add the broccoli and carrots first — these are the hardest vegetables and need 2 minutes head start. Toss frequently. Add the bell pepper, snap peas, and cabbage and stir-fry for another 2-3 minutes. The vegetables should be bright in color, tender-crisp, and still have a slight bite — not soft or dull."
  - "ADD AROMATICS: Push the vegetables to the outer edge of the wok. Add the garlic and ginger to the center of the pan and cook for 30 seconds, stirring constantly, until fragrant but not burned."
  - "BRING IT ALL TOGETHER: Return the cooked chicken to the wok. Pour the sauce over everything and toss to coat evenly. Give the cornstarch slurry a quick stir (the starch settles), then pour it in. Toss everything together over high heat for 60-90 seconds until the sauce thickens, turns glossy, and clings to the chicken and vegetables."
  - "SERVE: Divide the brown rice into four bowls (about 1/2 cup per serving). Ladle the stir-fry evenly over each bowl. Garnish with sliced green onions and a pinch of sesame seeds. Serve immediately while the vegetables are still vibrant."

If you've ever stood over a wok at 6pm wondering how to make a weeknight stir-fry that actually fills you up without sending your blood sugar on a rollercoaster, this recipe is for you.

Chicken stir-fry is one of the most-searched weeknight dinners on the internet — and for good reason. It's fast, flexible, and infinitely customizable. But most popular versions are swimming in sugary sauce, made with white rice, and leave you hungry an hour later. I've been making stir-fry for years, and once I started working with clients on GLP-1 medications like semaglutide and tirzepatide, I spent serious time reworking this classic to make it genuinely satisfying at smaller portions.

The secret comes down to three things: high-protein chicken, a fiber-rich vegetable lineup, and brown rice — not as a diet compromise, but because short-grain brown rice has a subtly nutty chew that actually holds up better under a savory sauce than white rice does.

Each serving lands at 350 calories with 30 grams of protein and 8 grams of fiber. That combination is ideal for GLP-1 users because protein and fiber both slow gastric emptying, which means you stay comfortably full on a smaller portion — exactly what these medications are designed to support.

A few things I've learned from making this dozens of times: First, dry your chicken. I know it sounds finicky, but wet chicken steams instead of searing, and that golden crust is where all the flavor lives. Second, don't crowd the pan. Use your largest skillet or a wok, and cook the chicken in two batches if needed. Third, prep everything before you light the burner. Stir-fry waits for no one — once the wok is hot, this dish comes together in under 10 minutes.

When buying chicken breast, look for pieces that are similar in thickness so they cook evenly. For the vegetables, this recipe works beautifully with whatever is in your crisper drawer — edamame, baby bok choy, mushrooms, and zucchini all sub in well. The one thing I'd encourage you not to skip is the snap peas: they add a satisfying crunch and a meaningful hit of fiber that rounds out the texture perfectly.

The sauce is intentionally light-handed — low-sodium soy sauce, a splash of rice vinegar, toasted sesame oil, and a tiny cornstarch slurry to make it glossy and clingy without piling on sugar or sodium. It coats every piece beautifully without pooling at the bottom of the bowl.

This recipe also meal-preps like a dream. I store the stir-fry and rice separately and reheat them together in a skillet with a splash of water to revive the sauce. It holds well for four days in the fridge.

Alright — let's get into the recipe. Everything you need is below.
