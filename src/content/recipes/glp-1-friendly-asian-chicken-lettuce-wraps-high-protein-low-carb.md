ingredients:
  - "1.25 lbs lean ground chicken (93% lean or higher) — or finely hand-chopped chicken breast for better texture"
  - "1 head butter lettuce (Boston or Bibb), leaves separated and rinsed — look for crisp, cup-shaped leaves"
  - "1 can (8 oz) water chestnuts, drained and finely diced — adds essential crunch without calories"
  - "1 cup shredded carrots (about 2 medium carrots)"
  - "1 cup finely diced shiitake mushrooms (about 4 oz) — stems removed, adds umami and fiber"
  - "3 stalks green onions, thinly sliced, whites and greens separated"
  - "3 cloves garlic, minced"
  - "1 tablespoon fresh ginger, finely grated (about a 1-inch piece)"
  - "2 tablespoons reduced-sodium hoisin sauce"
  - "2 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce or tamari (for gluten-free)"
  - "1 tablespoon rice vinegar"
  - "1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil"
  - "1 teaspoon chili garlic sauce (such as sambal oelek), adjust to taste"
  - "1 teaspoon avocado oil or light sesame oil, for cooking"
  - "1 tablespoon cornstarch mixed with 2 tablespoons cold water (slurry)"
  - "2 tablespoons roasted salted peanuts, roughly chopped — for garnish"
  - "Fresh cilantro leaves, for garnish"
  - "Lime wedges, for serving"
instructions:
  - "Make the sauce: In a small bowl, whisk together the hoisin sauce, soy sauce, rice vinegar, toasted sesame oil, and chili garlic sauce until smooth. Set aside. Having this ready before you start cooking is key — the stir-fry moves fast."
  - "Prep your vegetables: Dice the water chestnuts and mushrooms into small, uniform pieces (about ¼-inch). This ensures every bite has balanced texture. Shred or buy pre-shredded carrots. Separate the green onion whites from the greens and keep them in two separate piles."
  - "Heat a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat until it just begins to smoke — about 2 minutes. Add the avocado oil and swirl to coat. A hot pan is the secret to getting the chicken properly browned instead of steamed."
  - "Add the ground chicken and break it up immediately with a wooden spoon or spatula into very small crumbles. Cook undisturbed for 2 minutes, then stir and continue cooking for another 3-4 minutes until no pink remains and the chicken has some golden-brown bits. Don't crowd the pan — if needed, cook in two batches."
  - "Push the chicken to the edges of the pan. Add the green onion whites, garlic, and ginger to the center. Sauté for 60-90 seconds until fragrant and the garlic is just golden — watch carefully so it doesn't burn."
  - "Add the diced mushrooms and carrots to the pan. Stir everything together and cook for 2-3 minutes until the mushrooms have released their moisture and the carrots soften slightly but still have a little bite."
  - "Add the diced water chestnuts and stir to combine. Pour the sauce evenly over the mixture and toss well to coat everything. Let it cook for 1 minute so the flavors meld."
  - "Give the cornstarch slurry a quick stir and drizzle it into the pan while stirring continuously. Cook for 1 minute more until the sauce thickens and clings to the chicken and vegetables — it should look glossy and saucy, not watery or thick like gravy."
  - "Remove from heat. Taste and adjust: add more chili garlic sauce for heat, a splash of rice vinegar for brightness, or a tiny bit more soy sauce for salt. The filling should be bold and savory."
  - "To serve: Arrange butter lettuce cups on a large platter. Spoon 2-3 heaping tablespoons of filling into each lettuce cup. Top with sliced green onion greens, chopped peanuts, and fresh cilantro. Serve immediately with lime wedges on the side. The filling will stay hot for about 10 minutes, so get these to the table quickly."

If you've ever sat down at a restaurant and ordered lettuce wraps as your 'healthy' appetizer only to wonder later why you felt so full and a little guilty — you're not alone. Most restaurant versions are loaded with hidden sugars, excess sodium, and enough oil to fry a small fish. But here's the thing: the bones of this dish are genuinely brilliant for anyone eating with intention, especially on a GLP-1 medication like semaglutide or tirzepatide.

I've been making lettuce wraps at home for over a decade, long before they became a staple on every casual dining menu. The version most people know and love — popularized by PF Chang's — gets its magic from a few specific things: the savory-sweet hoisin base, the crunch of water chestnuts, the aromatic punch of fresh ginger and garlic, and the cool contrast of the lettuce cup itself. My GLP-1 friendly adaptation keeps every single one of those elements intact.

What I've changed is strategic, not sacrificial. I use lean ground chicken (93% lean) instead of a fattier blend, swap in shiitake mushrooms to add umami depth and sneak in extra fiber, and I've dialed back the hoisin and oil just enough to bring the calories into a GLP-1 appropriate range without making the dish taste like diet food. Each serving clocks in at 350 calories with 30 grams of protein and 8 grams of fiber — exactly the kind of macro profile that supports satiety on reduced appetite medications.

A few things I've learned from making this dozens of times: First, the pan temperature matters more than almost anything else. A screaming hot skillet gives you those slightly crispy, golden-brown bits of chicken that make the filling irresistible. A lukewarm pan gives you grey, steamed mush. Second, don't skip the cornstarch slurry — it's just a teaspoon's worth, but it transforms the sauce from watery to glossy and clingy in a way that makes every bite cohesive. Third, water chestnuts are non-negotiable. They're low calorie, add a satisfying crunch that doesn't get soggy, and are available in every grocery store in the canned goods aisle.

For the lettuce, butter lettuce (also sold as Boston or Bibb) is the gold standard. The leaves are naturally cup-shaped, sturdy enough to hold the filling without breaking, and tender enough to bite through cleanly. Avoid iceberg — it shatters — and romaine, which is too stiff and awkward to fold.

This recipe is also excellent for meal prep. Make a double batch of the filling, store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to four days, and just reheat individual portions in a skillet. Keep your lettuce leaves separate and assemble fresh. It's one of those rare high-protein lunches that actually reheats beautifully.
