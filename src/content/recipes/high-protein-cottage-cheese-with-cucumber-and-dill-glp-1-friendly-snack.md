ingredients:
  - "2 cups 4% milkfat full-fat cottage cheese (look for small curd for best texture; Good Culture or Daisy are excellent options with minimal additives)"
  - "1 large English cucumber (about 12 oz), halved lengthwise, seeded with a spoon, and sliced into thin half-moons — about ¼ inch thick"
  - "3 tablespoons fresh dill, roughly chopped (do not use dried dill here; the fresh herb is essential for bright, grassy flavor)"
  - "1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil"
  - "1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice (from about ¼ of a lemon)"
  - "¼ teaspoon fine sea salt, plus more to taste"
  - "¼ teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper"
  - "1 small clove garlic, finely grated on a microplane (optional, but highly recommended for depth)"
  - "1 tablespoon raw pumpkin seeds (pepitas) per serving, for crunch and added fiber — about ¼ cup total"
  - "Pinch of red pepper flakes (optional, for a gentle kick)"
instructions:
  - "Salt the cucumber first: Place the sliced cucumber in a colander set over a bowl. Sprinkle with a pinch of salt, toss gently, and let sit for 5–10 minutes. This draws out excess moisture so your cottage cheese doesn't become watery. Pat dry thoroughly with a clean kitchen towel or paper towels. This step makes a dramatic difference in the final texture."
  - "Season the cottage cheese base: In a medium mixing bowl, combine the cottage cheese, olive oil, lemon juice, grated garlic (if using), salt, and black pepper. Stir gently until everything is just combined — you want to keep some of the curd texture intact rather than breaking it down into a smooth paste. Taste and adjust salt and lemon juice as needed."
  - "Fold in the cucumber and herbs: Add the patted-dry cucumber slices and two-thirds of the fresh dill to the cottage cheese mixture. Using a rubber spatula, fold everything together with two or three gentle strokes. Do not over-mix — you want visible ribbons of herb and cucumber throughout."
  - "Plate and garnish: Divide the mixture evenly among four small bowls or shallow plates (about ½ cup per serving). Scatter the remaining fresh dill on top. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of pumpkin seeds over each serving for crunch, fiber, and a subtle nuttiness. Add red pepper flakes if desired."
  - "Serve immediately for the best texture, or cover and refrigerate for up to 2 hours. If making ahead, store the cucumber mixture and pumpkin seeds separately and combine just before serving to maintain crunch and prevent sogginess."

If you've ever opened your fridge at 3pm and stared blankly at shelves full of food but had absolutely no idea what to eat that wouldn't undo your progress — this recipe is for you.

Cottage cheese with cucumber and dill is one of those deceptively simple dishes that has been a staple in Eastern European and Mediterranean kitchens for generations. I first encountered it at a friend's Ukrainian grandmother's table, where it was served alongside dark rye bread as a casual summer lunch. One bite of that cool, creamy, herbaceous bowl and I was completely hooked. I've been making my own version ever since — and after years of refining it, this is the one I keep coming back to.

What makes this version especially powerful for people on GLP-1 medications like semaglutide or tirzepatide is how effectively it works with your already-reduced appetite. Each serving lands at around 145 calories and delivers 14 grams of protein — that's a remarkable ratio that keeps you satisfied without feeling heavy or overfull. The cottage cheese provides slow-digesting casein protein, while the pumpkin seeds add a meaningful hit of fiber and healthy fat that slows gastric emptying even further.

The cucumber is doing more than you might think here. Beyond hydration and freshness, it adds crunch and volume that makes this small portion feel genuinely satisfying. The one mistake I see people make constantly is skipping the salting step — pulling moisture from the cucumber before mixing prevents the whole bowl from turning into a watery puddle within minutes. Don't skip it.

When buying cottage cheese, I strongly recommend full-fat (4% milkfat) small curd over low-fat versions. The fat content is modest per serving but dramatically improves texture and keeps you full longer. Look for brands with short ingredient lists — just milk, cream, and cultures. Many store-brand low-fat versions add gums and thickeners that affect both texture and digestion.

Fresh dill is non-negotiable in this recipe. The dried version simply doesn't deliver the same grassy, slightly anise-like brightness that makes this dish sing. If dill isn't your thing, fresh chives or a combination of both work beautifully.

I've served this as an afternoon snack, a light post-workout bite, and even a starter before dinner on nights when I want to take the edge off hunger before cooking. It comes together in under five minutes, requires zero cooking, and travels well in a small container if you prep it the night before — just keep the seeds separate until serving.
