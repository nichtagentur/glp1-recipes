A golden drizzle of almond butter weaves between the berries, scattered black chia seeds add texture throughout, and a small mound of golden granola sits on one side. A delicate honey drizzle catches the natural light. The bowl sits on a light marble surface next to a linen napkin and a small sprig of fresh mint, with soft morning window light illuminating the vibrant colors."
