ingredients:
  - "8 slices (about 6 oz) deli turkey breast, low-sodium"
  - "4 slices (2 oz) sharp cheddar cheese, halved"
  - "1/2 medium cucumber, cut into thin spears"
  - "1 medium avocado, sliced into 8 thin strips"
  - "1/4 cup hummus (plain or roasted red pepper)"
  - "2 tbsp sun-dried tomatoes, finely chopped"
  - "1 tsp Dijon mustard"
  - "1/4 tsp garlic powder"
  - "1/4 tsp black pepper"
  - "8 large fresh basil leaves"
  - "1 tbsp everything bagel seasoning (for garnish)"
  - "Optional: 8 toothpicks or skewers to secure"
instructions:
  - "Lay out all 8 turkey slices flat on a clean cutting board or large plate, ensuring they don't overlap."
  - "In a small bowl, mix the hummus with Dijon mustard, garlic powder, and black pepper until well combined."
  - "Spread about 1 teaspoon of the hummus mixture evenly over each turkey slice, leaving a small border around the edges."
  - "Place one halved slice of cheddar cheese on the bottom third of each turkey slice."
  - "Add one basil leaf on top of the cheese on each turkey slice."
  - "Place one strip of avocado and one spear of cucumber side by side on top of the basil, perpendicular to the rolling direction."
  - "Sprinkle a small pinch of sun-dried tomatoes over the fillings on each roll-up."
  - "Starting from the bottom edge (the side with the fillings), carefully roll each turkey slice tightly around the fillings, keeping the roll as compact as possible."
  - "Secure each roll-up with a toothpick or small skewer inserted through the center at a slight diagonal to hold the shape."
  - "Arrange the finished roll-ups seam-side down on a serving plate. Sprinkle with everything bagel seasoning for extra flavor and texture."
  - "Serve immediately, or cover and refrigerate for up to 24 hours. Remove toothpicks before eating."

imagePrompt: "Eight neatly assembled turkey and cheese roll-ups arranged in two diagonal rows on a clean white rectangular plate. Each roll-up is sliced in half diagonally to reveal colorful layers of pale turkey, golden cheddar cheese, creamy avocado, and fresh green cucumber inside. The roll-ups are garnished with everything bagel seasoning on top and a small side of hummus in a white dipping bowl. A few fresh basil leaves and sliced cucumber are scattered artfully around the plate. Bright, natural lighting highlights the fresh colors and textures of the ingredients, shot from a slight overhead angle."
