ingredients:
  - "1.5 lbs boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 4 medium breasts)"
  - "2 tablespoons olive oil, divided"
  - "1 teaspoon garlic powder"
  - "1 teaspoon smoked paprika"
  - "1/2 teaspoon onion powder"
  - "1/2 teaspoon dried oregano"
  - "1/2 teaspoon salt"
  - "1/4 teaspoon black pepper"
  - "3 cups broccoli florets (about 1 medium head)"
  - "2 medium zucchini, sliced into half-moons"
  - "1 large red bell pepper, seeded and chopped"
  - "1 large yellow bell pepper, seeded and chopped"
  - "1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved"
  - "3/4 cup dry brown rice (yields about 2 cups cooked)"
  - "1.5 cups low-sodium chicken broth (for cooking rice)"
  - "2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice"
  - "2 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)"
instructions:
  - "Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C) and line two large baking sheets with parchment paper."
  - "Cook the brown rice by combining 3/4 cup dry rice with 1.5 cups low-sodium chicken broth in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 40-45 minutes until liquid is absorbed. Set aside to cool slightly."
  - "Pat the chicken breasts dry with paper towels. In a small bowl, combine garlic powder, smoked paprika, onion powder, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper. Rub 1 tablespoon of olive oil over the chicken, then coat evenly with the spice mixture."
  - "Place the seasoned chicken breasts on one prepared baking sheet. Bake at 425°F for 22-26 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 165°F. Remove from oven and let rest for 5 minutes before slicing."
  - "While the chicken cooks, toss broccoli florets, zucchini, red bell pepper, and yellow bell pepper with the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper on the second baking sheet. Spread into a single layer."
  - "Roast the vegetables at 425°F for 20-25 minutes, stirring halfway through, until tender and slightly caramelized at the edges. Add the halved cherry tomatoes in the last 5 minutes of roasting."
  - "Slice the rested chicken breasts against the grain into even strips for easier eating and portion control."
  - "Divide the cooked brown rice evenly among four meal prep containers, placing it in one section of each container."
  - "Distribute the roasted vegetables equally among the four containers alongside the rice."
  - "Add an equal portion of sliced chicken on top of the vegetables or in a separate section of each container."
  - "Drizzle each container with approximately 1.5 teaspoons of fresh lemon juice and garnish with fresh parsley."
  - "Allow containers to cool completely before sealing. Refrigerate for up to 4 days. To reheat, microwave uncovered for 2-3 minutes, stirring halfway through."
