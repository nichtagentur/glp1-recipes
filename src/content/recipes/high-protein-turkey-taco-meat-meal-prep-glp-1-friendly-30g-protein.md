ingredients:
  - "1 lb 93% lean ground turkey (not 99% fat-free — the slight fat content keeps it juicy and prevents dryness)"
  - "1 can (15 oz) black beans, drained and rinsed (adds fiber and plant-based protein)"
  - "1 cup chunky tomato salsa, store-bought or homemade (look for less than 200mg sodium per serving)"
  - "1 small white onion, finely diced (about 3/4 cup)"
  - "4 cloves garlic, minced"
  - "1 jalapeño, seeded and finely diced (leave seeds in for more heat)"
  - "2 tsp chili powder"
  - "1 tsp ground cumin"
  - "1 tsp smoked paprika"
  - "1/2 tsp dried oregano"
  - "1/4 tsp cayenne pepper (optional, for heat)"
  - "1/2 tsp fine sea salt, plus more to taste"
  - "1 tbsp avocado oil or olive oil"
  - "1/4 cup low-sodium chicken broth (keeps the meat from drying out)"
  - "Juice of 1 lime"
  - "1/4 cup fresh cilantro, roughly chopped"
  - "FOR SERVING (per bowl): 1/2 cup shredded green cabbage, 2 tbsp pico de gallo, 2 tbsp plain 2% Greek yogurt (as sour cream substitute), 1/4 small avocado sliced"
  - "Optional: 1 small corn tortilla per serving (adds ~50 calories, 1g fiber)"
instructions:
  - "Set out all your ingredients before heating the pan — this recipe moves quickly once the turkey hits the skillet. Drain and rinse the black beans, dice the onion and jalapeño, and mince the garlic. Mix the chili powder, cumin, smoked paprika, oregano, cayenne, and salt together in a small bowl so your spice blend is ready to go."
  - "Heat a large (12-inch) skillet or sauté pan over medium-high heat. Add the avocado oil and let it shimmer — about 60 seconds. Add the diced onion and jalapeño and cook, stirring occasionally, for 4-5 minutes until the onion is soft and just starting to turn golden at the edges."
  - "Add the minced garlic and cook for 60 seconds more, stirring constantly so it doesn't burn. You'll smell the garlic turn fragrant and slightly sweet — that's your cue to move on."
  - "Add the ground turkey to the pan, breaking it up immediately with a wooden spoon or meat chopper into very small crumbles (smaller crumbles = better seasoning distribution and texture). Cook over medium-high heat for 6-7 minutes, stirring every 60 seconds, until the turkey is fully cooked through with no pink remaining and some pieces are lightly browned."
  - "Reduce heat to medium. Add the spice blend directly to the meat and stir well to coat every crumble. Toast the spices in the pan for 90 seconds — this step blooms the spices and deepens the flavor dramatically. Don't skip it."
  - "Pour in the salsa, chicken broth, and drained black beans. Stir everything together and bring to a gentle simmer. Cook uncovered for 8-10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until most of the liquid has reduced and the mixture is saucy but not soupy. The beans will soften slightly and absorb the seasoned liquid — this is exactly what you want."
  - "Remove from heat. Squeeze the lime juice over the top and stir in the fresh cilantro. Taste and adjust salt if needed. The taco meat should be boldly seasoned, slightly smoky, and have just enough sauciness to coat the back of a spoon."
  - "FOR MEAL PREP: Divide the taco meat evenly into 4 airtight containers (roughly 3/4 cup per serving). Add the shredded cabbage and pico de gallo to each container. Store the Greek yogurt and avocado separately to add fresh at serving time. Refrigerate for up to 4 days. Reheat the taco meat in a skillet over medium heat with a splash of water or broth, or microwave covered for 90 seconds, stirring halfway through."

If you've been searching for a taco meat recipe that actually holds up all week in the fridge — one that stays juicy on day four, reheats beautifully, and keeps you full for hours — you've found it.

Taco Tuesday is great, but taco meal prep? That's a game-changer, especially when you're on a GLP-1 medication like semaglutide or tirzepatide and your appetite and tolerance for large meals has completely shifted.

I've made some version of turkey taco meat almost every single week for the past two years, and I've tested this particular recipe more times than I can count. What separates the good batches from the dry, bland, forgettable ones comes down to three things: the fat percentage of your turkey, blooming your spices, and that final simmer with salsa and black beans.

Most recipes call for 99% fat-free ground turkey to cut calories, and that's exactly why most recipes produce chalky, sad taco meat. I use 93% lean — the small difference in fat content is significant for texture and flavor, and the calorie difference is minimal. This is one of those cases where the 'leaner' choice is actually the worse choice.

The black beans are not just filler. They bring 7-8 grams of fiber per half-cup serving, which is critical for people on GLP-1 medications. Fiber slows digestion, supports gut health, and amplifies that satiety signal your medication is already sending. Each serving of this recipe clocks in at 30 grams of protein and 8 grams of fiber — that combination is exactly what keeps you satisfied between meals without needing a large volume of food.

When you're shopping, look for a salsa with a short ingredient list and no corn syrup — you want tomatoes, onion, jalapeño, and spices. The quality of your salsa is doing real flavor work here, so don't reach for the watery store-brand version.

One mistake I see constantly: people cook the spices with the raw meat instead of after. Adding your spice blend to already-cooked turkey and letting it toast in the dry pan for 90 seconds before adding any liquid is the single biggest flavor upgrade you can make. It's the difference between taco meat that tastes like Tuesday and taco meat that tastes like your favorite Mexican restaurant.

Each serving is built as a complete bowl — taco meat and beans over shredded cabbage (which adds crunch and a surprisingly digestible fiber source), a spoonful of pico, sliced avocado for healthy fat, and a dollop of plain Greek yogurt in place of sour cream. You get the full taco experience, controlled portions, and a meal that genuinely satisfies.
