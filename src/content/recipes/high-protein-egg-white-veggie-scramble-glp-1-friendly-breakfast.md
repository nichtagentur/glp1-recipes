ingredients:
  - "2 cups liquid egg whites (from a carton, such as 100% pure pasteurized egg whites -- about 16 oz)"
  - "4 large whole eggs (for yolk richness and binding)"
  - "1 cup baby spinach, roughly chopped"
  - "1 medium red bell pepper, diced into ¼-inch pieces"
  - "1 medium yellow bell pepper, diced into ¼-inch pieces"
  - "1 cup cremini mushrooms, thinly sliced"
  - "½ medium yellow onion, finely diced"
  - "2 cloves garlic, minced"
  - "½ cup canned black beans, drained and rinsed (for fiber and protein boost)"
  - "¼ cup crumbled reduced-fat feta cheese (about 1 oz)"
  - "1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, divided"
  - "1 teaspoon smoked paprika"
  - "½ teaspoon ground cumin"
  - "½ teaspoon dried oregano"
  - "¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes (optional, for heat)"
  - "Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste"
  - "2 tablespoons fresh flat-leaf parsley or chives, finely chopped (for garnish)"
  - "Hot sauce of choice, for serving (optional)"
instructions:
  - "In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the liquid egg whites and 4 whole eggs until fully combined and slightly frothy, about 60 seconds. Season lightly with salt, black pepper, and ¼ teaspoon of the smoked paprika. Set aside."
  - "Heat ½ tablespoon of olive oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat. Once the oil shimmers (about 1 minute), add the diced onion and cook, stirring occasionally, for 3 minutes until softened and translucent."
  - "Add the garlic, red and yellow bell peppers, and mushrooms to the skillet. Season with the remaining smoked paprika, cumin, oregano, and red pepper flakes. Cook, stirring every minute, for 4-5 minutes until the mushrooms have released their liquid and the peppers are tender but still have a slight bite. You'll know it's ready when the pan looks mostly dry again."
  - "Add the black beans and baby spinach. Stir and cook for 1 minute until the spinach wilts completely and the beans are warmed through. Push the veggie mixture to one side of the pan."
  - "Add the remaining ½ tablespoon of olive oil to the empty side of the pan and let it heat for 30 seconds. Pour the egg mixture over the entire surface of the pan, on top of and around the vegetables."
  - "Let the eggs sit undisturbed for 30-45 seconds until you see the edges begin to set and turn opaque. Using a silicone spatula, gently fold the eggs from the outside edges toward the center in large, slow curds. Do NOT stir aggressively -- slow, deliberate folds create fluffy, restaurant-quality curds."
  - "Continue folding every 20-30 seconds. Remove the pan from the heat when the eggs are about 80% set -- they should look glossy and still slightly wet in the center (carry-over cooking will finish them perfectly). This takes about 2-3 minutes total. Overcooked egg whites turn rubbery, so pulling them early is the key to a silky texture."
  - "Sprinkle the crumbled feta cheese over the top and fold in gently one final time. Divide into 4 equal portions, garnish generously with fresh parsley or chives, and serve immediately with hot sauce on the side."

If you're searching for a breakfast that actually keeps you full on a GLP-1 medication without making you feel overstuffed or heavy afterward, this egg white veggie scramble is about to become your new weekday staple.

I've made dozens of egg white scrambles over the years, and I'll be honest -- most of them were sad. Rubbery, bland, watery. The kind of thing you choke down because it's 'healthy' rather than because it tastes good. What changed everything for me was understanding two things: building flavor through the vegetables first, and mastering the low-and-slow fold technique that gives egg whites an actually custardy, fluffy texture.

This recipe is built on the foundation of a classic diner-style veggie scramble, but every ingredient has been chosen with intention. The combination of liquid egg whites AND whole eggs is something I learned from restaurant cooks -- the yolks provide just enough fat and richness to keep the whites from tasting flat and rubbery. It's a small addition that makes a dramatic difference in flavor and texture.

For anyone on GLP-1 medications like semaglutide or tirzepatide, this breakfast hits all the right notes. With 30 grams of protein and 8 grams of fiber per serving, it supports satiety signals without loading your stomach with excess volume or fat. The black beans are a secret weapon here -- they add a subtle creaminess, a meaningful fiber boost, and extra plant-based protein that rounds out the macros beautifully.

When buying your ingredients, look for carton egg whites that list '100% egg whites' with no additives or gums -- some brands sneak in stabilizers that affect texture. For the vegetables, feel free to swap in whatever you have: zucchini, cherry tomatoes, and asparagus all work wonderfully. The smoked paprika and cumin are non-negotiable in my kitchen -- they transform this from a basic egg dish into something genuinely craveable.

The biggest mistake I see people make with egg white scrambles is cooking them on too-high heat. Medium heat, patience, and large slow folds are the entire secret. Walk away from the stove for even 30 seconds on high heat and you'll end up with something that bounces off the plate.

This recipe also scales beautifully for meal prep -- cook the veggie base ahead of time and refrigerate it, then scramble fresh eggs into it each morning in under five minutes. Ready to make the best egg white scramble of your life? Let's get into it.
